0.5.3 / 2013-01-30
==================
  * Fix check for lockdir when attribute is missing.

0.5.2 / 2013-01-29
==================
  * Add MANIFEST to get long_description working from a sdist.

0.5.1 / 2013-01-29
==================
  * Fix setup.py to not bork due to long description. See #1
  * Change to a null_synchronizer since we're relying on MongoDB not FS locks
  * Lint the heck out of the code.


0.5 / 2011-01-21
==================

  * Major refactor of how data is stored, which fixes a number of bugs which
    were creating duplicate entries
    - _id field is now generated by cache to guarantee no dupe entries, instead
      of using objectID.  See the docs for details.
  * Moved to official MongoDB URI format for connections, allows slaveok
    parameter
  * Fixed more outstanding issues; bad code was making lookups fail.
  * Added support for Sparse collections, in which each key is a row.
    -  For Beaker Sessions, this already happens automatically, but in say
       Pylons Caching of a specific template, it puts it all in one place.
    -  This forces it to split, and should help performance.
